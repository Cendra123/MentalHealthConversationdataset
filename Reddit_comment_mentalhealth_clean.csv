32,1777,2," I am a Bachelor in psychology that is currently studying this field and I can confirm that it is true. Here is the research that talks about the minutes in nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598%20019%2044097%203 Passing time in nature, as little as 15 minutes can already make you feel better. The most efficient time span is 20-30 minutes though. Weekly, the most benefit comes after two total hours, up to 200/300 minutes. At that time you reach a plateau. The theoretical framework is called Attention Restoration Theory (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_restoration_theory, at the moment I cannot find the original paper but here you have a nice summary) and is part of the Biophilic Approach (I suggest you to read about this because it‚Äôs very interesting and not heard about) Also, another useful theory based on Kaplan‚Äôs is the one by Ulrich (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494405801847 , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249623753_Natural_Versus_Urban_Scenes_Some_Psychophysiological_Effects). He discovered that passing time in nature even reduces the feeling of stress. Further researches proved that this is also true for anxiety So even if you are not the outdoor type of person I suggest you to try and find ‚Äúyour‚Äù personal and most fitting natural spot, because the benefits are too good to ignore.

This is just one of multiple anti-transgender laws he has championed, to say nothing of his other laws targeting LGTBQ and racial education in Florida schools and policies in Florida businesses. All these laws are basically his audition to the right-side of the Republican party. He has a very steep hill to climb to beat Trump in the primaries, so his strategy is clearly to ""out-right"" Trump on hotbutton issues.",2866,Positive,0.3182,119,606

He's even gotten Florida law changed so he doesn't have to resign to run for POTUS. He's done everything to run, save formally announce. Florida tacked hard right in the 2022 mid-term elections, giving the GOP control of the Florida legislature, alongside the Governorship. This has allowed the Florida GOP to enact its agenda in force, treating Florida as a test-case for right-leaning policy they hope to enact across the country. So, they ""how"" is simple - this is what the GOP wants, and Floridians (that voted) wanted GOP lawmakers in power. It is happening in other places too, but Florida is in the limelight because they are pushing harder than most and DeSantis is on the national stage due to his Presidential ambitions. I'll avoid commenting on the rest of your reply, as that is really opinion on whether the policy is good or bad.

318,13560,1, Why is it harder to retrieve memories as we age?,112,Neutral,0.0,11,49
319,13560,2," Thanks for the question! We know that aging normally causes a decline in our declarative memory, which is the conscious recollection of facts and events (stuff we can ‚Äúdeclare‚Äù in words). Within the category of declarative memory, our episodic memory (about our life experiences and events) is typically more impacted than our semantic memory (facts about the world). By some measures, the average 80-year olds can remember about half as much as they could when they were 50. (Interestingly, our procedural memory, which is our long-term unconscious memory of how to do something, such as riding a bike, is typically not as affected by aging.) As we age, our brain normally shrinks, including in the hippocampus, which is important for episodic memory. Our cortical areas also appear to get less selective responding to information (this decreased neural selectivity is called dedifferentiation), which is associated with worse episodic memory. Our neural circuits become less plastic and able to form new connections, which could make it harder to encode, consolidate and retrieve memories with age. But it need not be this way! There are actually three major possible trajectories for our memory as we age: - There‚Äôs the pathologic trajectory, where cognition gets worse faster than expected, like in dementia. Unfortunately, aging is the biggest risk factor for developing dementia ‚Äì an estimated 1 in 3 Americans older than 85 have Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer‚Äôs Association. - In the average trajectory, our ability to remember things still diminishes. Still, there is remarkable variability in memory ability. (And aging brains can still retain a lot of plasticity.) - The third trajectory are the SuperAgers, who are people older than 80 that nonetheless have memory that is as good, if not better, than those in their 50s and 60s. I recently wrote about what SuperAgers can teach us about cognitive health. Their brains appear to be more youthful, particularly in areas thought to be important for memory and executive functions. Researchers looking that their brains found they had healthier and larger neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a memory center, even compared to younger people. They also had a thicker anterior cingulate cortex, which is important for memory and attention, as well as denser amounts of von Economo neurons, which are believed to be important for social affiliative behaviors. Of course, some of it is just luck of the genetic lottery, and true SuperAgers appear to be rare. The researcher I spoke to estimated less than 10% of people that they screened qualified. But studying these SuperAgers does provide some insights into what they and their brains are doing differently. For one, they appear to be more resilient to change and stress, which is something we can all train to be better at. They also manage to make enduring social relationships, which is not only generally good for our health but also provides a lot of novel stimulation that could help keep our brains young.",99,Positive,0.9832,578,3069

524,20326,2," It is absolutely possible to recover from the most painful aspects of childhood trauma where it no longer negatively impairs your ability to function in your life and relationships. However our traumatic experiences are always a part of us. I like to think of our lives as a quilt - some patches are pretty,, some ugly, some downright scary however together they make something beautiful that can nurture us. So part of recovery is integrating our traumatic experiences so they are one patch on a quilt and not the whole thing.  On a more scientific note, there is growing evidence that if we attend to and treat the mental health consequences of trauma we will reduce the likelihood of the physical health consequences down the road. For example, we have shown that if you reduce peoples PTSD symptoms you reduce their risk of heart disease and other people have shown this too. So one of the best things that a trauma survivors can do is attend to their mental health and that will have a big pay off in terms of their physical health.

This is not true, the most likely people to be obese are the ones who already have body image problems, already are under a ton of stress, already have been bullied for their appearance, already have health issues, etc... People generally do not lose weight because they are bullied. They gain weight because they are bullied. If you abuse people their mental health will degrade. With mental health degrading physical health always follows. And I don't care if the term stress eating triggers you. People who are overworked, depressed, abused, etc... do not prioritize their own health and turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, and 9 times out of 10 they cause you to gain weight. Gaining weight cause body image issues which in turn worsens the coping mechanisms. People LOSE weight not because they have been mentally broken. But because they caught a lucky break in their lives and can for once focus on themselves. Because they have build themselves up. Because their mental health improved. Body positivity if anything is about improving the idea of body image. Which if anything, is about improving people's mental health.

Every day the world reminds you that you are fat, whether it's disapproving looks at fast food joints, the constant barrage of gym and weight loss product advertisements, the obvious disparity between the latest Bachelor or Bachelorette with their shirt off and you with yours off, squeezing into a tiny airplane seat, your ""helpful"" friends and family saying ""well, if you would only ___ you'd lose weight."" There is no such thing as a fat person that isn't fully cognizant of their weight all day every day. The difference is, the ""fat acceptance"" movement that has sprung up is a massive pendulum shift overreaction to the notion that America is pretty darn obese. We've gone from jokes about Howard's mother on Big Bang Theory to ""Fuck you, I'm 5'2"" and 400 lbs and I'm BEAUTIFUL!"" And the reaction has happened because of America's obsession with obesity. The Biggest Loser, every third commercial on daytime and primetime TV, the chubby best friend that never gets the girl, it's constant. So of course fat people are going to shut down and wall up and say ""fuck you"" to the whole thing. Obesity is a disease. Life-threatening. Treatable. Often (but not always) voluntary at least to start. Over the past few decades, we've slowed or stopped the use of mental health, alcoholism, HIV, and dysphoria as punchlines, and yet obesity continues, so some of us fatties are digging in our heels on it.

That's a horrifyingly dangerous disregard for anatomical science. But these people don't need to be mocked or shamed. Fat people don't need to be a punchline or a clickbait headline.

Unfortunately, they did not reciprocate with providing a standard washing experience.

593,22272,3," OK I feel like this may be beyond Reddit‚Äôs pay grade and I know it‚Äôs probably way beyond mine too but I am going to try to help you. First of all, I think you need see a doctor to see if you have developed some kind of skin condition. I itch if I DON‚ÄôT take a shower, so I it‚Äôs possible that you have some dead skin buildup from not showering that then itches when you get out, because there‚Äôs no way to exfoliate it all in one bathing. That‚Äôs just speculation, and I‚Äôm no medical professional, but it‚Äôs probable that showering more frequently will eliminate this problem altogether. I‚Äôm so sorry for your childhood trauma. I carry plenty of my own around, and it can be a struggle. You didn‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that, especially for something that you couldn‚Äôt help and were already carrying shame about, I‚Äôm sure. Sending you a long squeezy Mom hug. I will tell you that with someone else with ADHD, making myself get into the shower can be difficult, not because I don‚Äôt love it, which I absolutely do, but I‚Äôm always doing something else and putting it off until the last minute when I have to go somewhere. I help motivate myself by making my shower a nice experience. My bathroom is clean and calming, I have soft fluffy towels, my body wash smells amazing. I have a glass shower door, so sometimes if I‚Äôm showering leisurely I will bring my iPad into the bathroom and put on a movie or some good music. Obviously I can‚Äôt hear it too well, but it satisfies the toddler-half of my brain so that I can get on with showering. My point is, besides the doctor, what can we do to try and flip the script on your bathing experience? I‚Äôm going to Mom you right now, and tell you what I would tell you if you were one of my daughters. How can we make it something good that you want to do? Think about the lighting. I mean, bring some candles into the bathroom to make it more like a spa experience, if that helps. Put on some nice music. Bring a bowl of snacks into the bathroom üòÅ. What is the temperature like? Make it warm and cozy. Do you have a bathtub or just a shower? They have some really great colloidal oatmeal baths that you can put into your tub to help your skin. If you just have a shower, they also make colloidal oatmeal body wash or there are recipes online where you can make your own. Once you have seen the doctor and get the ok, try some body lotion in your favorite scents afterwards. They also make little shower bombs that you can put in the floor of your shower that come in soothing scents like lavender. It doesn‚Äôt actually get on your skin, just makes your shower smell nice. Use a soft washcloth to gently wipe your skin, but don‚Äôt scrub hard. Think of a mom washing a baby. You‚Äôre trying to care for yourself and be kind to yourself, not punish yourself. You deserve to be loved and taken care of. I‚Äôm sorry no one did that for you, but now you‚Äôre older you can do it for yourself. You deserve it, friend. Make your shower your happy place. Sending you all good vibes. You got this. Edit: thank you all for the awards! We've all been through it, we deserve some tender care and to be gentle with ourselves. I know it's hard sometimes.

594,22272,4," This is a great reply. I‚Äôd also add, trying to overcome your learned aversion to a bath or shower from your parents scrubbing and the shame of bed wetting isn‚Äôt something you can just push through, at least not if you want long term behavioral changes (basically to start to undo the past trauma). But if you can do this stepwise you can begin to de-condition yourself to the fear or aversion response. Can you use cleaning wipes/wet wipes without your skin reacting and to help with cleanliness? You don‚Äôt even have to do this in the bathroom because setting is probably part of the trigger for you. But if you can start small with just wipes or a wash cloth or paper towel or even cotton balls with alcohol or peroxide on them for your pits and other stinky places, that can be a place to start that your brain can tolerate. Then when you‚Äôre comfortable doing that not in the bathroom, try it just outside the bathroom, then eventually move into the bathroom itself, then in the tub, then not in the tub but with water in the tub or with the shower on (even briefly). Then work on time in the bath/shower. The more you can slowly teach your body that it‚Äôs ok, the easier it will be. At any of these steps incorporate positive reinforcement if you can, listen to music you like, or eat some chocolate, watch something that makes you laugh or feel good. This will all help subconsciously retrain your brain. This is just a suggestion for how to break it down to let your brain tolerate it. I can‚Äôt address the skin itching and irritation or past trauma, and I‚Äôd highly recommend speaking to a behavioral therapist that can work with you specifically on retraining your brain on your habits while also dealing with past trauma.",185,Positive,0.9416,357,1727

604,22525,1," Ex high school teacher - left Sept 2022. The issues are great and varied. How can I help my students who need me the most when my class size is 30? Of those 30, about 10 choose to sit around and treat the classroom like their personal lounge. I've had kids vape in my face. The admin workload is horrendous; I just wanted to teach my students, not have my time taken up by red tape. Overall, as a young person (30F), I found the depts I worked in were staffed by older folk. They have been in their jobs for so long they're jaded about their jobs and the state of education. How can I make a change when these are the walls I'm up against? Their way of doing things (admin, teaching, resources, etc) is often outdated too. The pay is a side issue; with everything we already deal with, teachers deserve more. I've had students disclose SA, DV, other home issues, lack of money, students not having lunch, students not having access to computers/laptops/internet so they can't work at home. We are more than teachers; we are also counselors, situation diffusers, Deans, offer guidance, social workers, and networkers for our students. This is ON TOP of the normal teaching load. We also deal with parents/whanau who are not necessarily the easiest to deal with.

Let me share a little bit about myself. I‚Äôm 36 years old and I have what most would consider to be a pretty good life. I‚Äôm not rich but I‚Äôm not poor, somewhere in between. I have a comfortable life, a good job that I can derive some kind of meaning and purpose from, and friends who truly care about me on a deep level. I‚Äôve worked hard to cultivate a more stoic and content mindset over the past several years. Working with a therapist the past few years has helped tremendously in this area. But in spite of all the progress I‚Äôve made, I still feel kind of stuck, like I have all of this untapped potential that I can‚Äôt access. I never thought my porn usage habits were problematic, but now I think they are. I think I‚Äôve tried to convince myself that watching relatively vanilla porn 1-2x/week is no big deal, and surely that can‚Äôt be responsible for my decreased energy/motivation, and my lack of interest in women and relationships in general. And maybe it‚Äôs not, but I think it‚Äôs naive of me to dismiss it without some experimentation with the removal thereof. So for the past 30 days I‚Äôve been abstaining from PMO (porn, masturbation, orgasm), and I have experienced some INSANE volatility in my emotions and psychological state. A couple days ago it was literally difficult to get out of bed. I felt like a husk of a person. I‚Äôve felt damn near suicidal, myself, at various points in the past 30 days whereas before I stopped using PMO I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to say I had felt that way for years. All of this is telling me that something is in fact going on as it relates to the removal of PMO. It can‚Äôt be a coincidence because this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve experimented with it and I remember experiencing very similarly wild fluctuations in mood from a day to day basis. What I‚Äôm saying is that porn truly does fuck with our brains. It fucks up our dopamine signaling/sensitization which essentially can lead to depression and anhedonia, and by extension, suicidal thoughts and feelings. You can feel better. Take it from me man. Your brain is highly capable of healing and you can exist in a MUCH better state of mind than what you occupy now. It is very possible. You will feel shame, guilt, and so many other terrible emotions, but these are all just fucking lies that our addicted brain tells us to justify continued usage. I just want you to know that what you‚Äôre feeling, while real, is simply cause and effect - and can be reversed and improved upon to a very high degree. One question I would ask is that if you were going to choose to continue living, and to keep fighting, why might you? Edit: Since this got some traction I want to provide some resources that I‚Äôve personally found extremely helpful in my journey thus far. I think it‚Äôs incredibly important to educate oneself as it relates to all things porn addiction because doing so helps us to get rid of the guilt and shame that can sometimes pull us back in.

684,24602,3," Something to talk with your therapist about and that I always tell people in this situation ; remember that ADHD is like 70-80% hereditary, it's very likely your parents either have ADHD or your parents were raised by your grandparents who had ADHD, not to mention the siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc that might have had it. Families like that can be very dysfunctional. I am from that environment and am the first diagnosed in my family at age 31. There was a lot of ""strong emotions"" in my house growing up. Lots of love and closeness but also the first sign of some kind of attitude or offensive question (all of us were very sensitive to criticisms lol) could turn into a screaming, yelling, cursing fight. My Mom told stories about her parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles and they were the ""wild"" family. This would've been the 1940s but known for loving bar fights, alcoholism, dying young from accidents, getting kicked out of the military, dropping out of school/college, not having careers or holding a job, so many things explainable by untreated ADHD. I assumed my house was that way because it was just taught to be, but then I got meds and therapy. Now that I know the difference and can take meds I recognize how 100% different I am while I'm on meds. Even knowing I have a temper/ADHD emotional dysregulation doesn't stop me from wanting to punch walls or slam doors or overreact and tell/curse/fight to what I perceive as criticisms (basically anyone questioning why/how I'm doing what I'm currently doing). Also now that I'm a parent and when medications have worn off it is near impossible to have the patience it takes to raise a toddler without getting frequently annoyed and eventually pissed off. I love my kids and would die for them but after an hour of the same kids song, the same toys, the same everything and then fighting me for diaper changes, meals, never sleeping or sitting still, hating going to bed no matter what strategy I try, basically anytime their dopamine source is taken away (they probably have ADHD I'm pretty convinced lol) I could definitely see how older generations would've struggled with tempers and yelling/spanking. Also, the sled medication of alcohol and cigarettes wouldn't have helped things. The psychiatry care prior to the 1990s is full of horror stories and got a bad reputation since frontal lobotomies were still a top choice for anyone that acted too crazy. What seems like common/easy knowledge to us now hadn't been so until like 20 years ago. This is not saying your parents have a pass to act like shit. But I'd always suggest looking at them like they might have untreated ADHD and at least attempt to educate them some. Anyone with ADHD that isn't in therapy/on meds might struggle to regulate emotions especially if they're told they did something very wrong even though that's what they were taught to do.",99,Negative,-0.9853,566,2884

(The Dr. above) 2: make unbelievable promises about a novel intervention that you can gain IP protections on. (Creating a functional monopoly on the service.) 3: undercut existing services for complex cases. Offer payers (i.e insurance) a quick fix to drive total reimbursement for a case down. By having a monopoly on the practice, this sets you up for 4‚Ä¶ 4: gain a price-setting (ie, monopolistic) position in the given market. You can now gouge everyone once you‚Äôve achieved scale by charging exorbitant rates. 5: keep as many patients as possible in your own care ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù, so you can drive profit by always referring back to the most profitable treatments. For instance, keep them in house for counseling so therapists can refer back to this DSR treatment. Instead of the therapist generating, say, $120/week in billings, now you‚Äôre generating that plus $2,000/3 weeks for a simple injection. So roughly $800/week instead. In addition, private equity LOVES specialists like anesthesiologists because the profit margins on those services in particular are immense. They are much less interested in proven, traditional interventions like trauma therapy, because of the timeline and slimmer margins.
